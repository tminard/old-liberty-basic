"rmfDLLv02" is for use with Liberty BASIC v3
********************************************
It contains two functions:
  InputBoxHEX()
  InputBoxRGB()
********************************************
1:- "InputBoxHEX"
	This function uses one internal function
	to convert the colour parameters (which
	are passed as strings from LB) to variables
	of type DOUBLE, which are then cast as LONG
	and used in the calls to SendMessage().
	This will create a single line input box.
        The background can be set to any colour.
        The font can be set to any colour.
        This version uses a HEX colour value as a parameter.
        The position and size can be set.
        The maximum number of chars entered can be set.

	The calling syntax is:

	open "rmfDLLv02.dll" for dll as #rmfdll

	calldll #rmfdll, "InputBoxHEX", _
	  handle    as long, _ ' handle of parent window
          inkHex$   as ptr, _  ' ink colour
          paperHex$ as ptr, _  ' paper colour
	  x         as long, _ ' x co-ord
	  y         as long, _ ' y co-ord
	  w         as long, _ ' width
	  h         as long, _ ' height
	  max       as long, _ ' max chars
	  hTB       as long    ' returns a handle to the new control
