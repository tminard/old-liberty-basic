Multi-Coloured Text Input Boxes using a DLL
by Ray Fisher

Following a short article in the November Newsletter,
I have been asked if there was any other way to assign
colours to the DLL, other than with HEX values. I have
developed another function which will accept RED, GREEN
and BLUE values. This function has been added to v02 of
the DLL. The two functions are now called:

	  InputBoxHEX()
	  InputBoxRGB()

The syntax is:

open "rmfDLLv02.dll" for dll as #rmfdll

calldll #rmfdll, "InputBoxHEX", _
  handle    as long, _ ' handle of parent window
  inkHex$   as ptr, _  ' ink colour
  paperHex$ as ptr, _  ' paper colour
  x         as long, _ ' x co-ord
  y         as long, _ ' y co-ord
  w         as long, _ ' width
  h         as long, _ ' height
  max       as long, _ ' max chars
  hTB       as long    ' returns a handle to the new control


calldll #rmfdll, "InputBoxRGB", _
  h      as long, _ ' handle of parent window
  inkR   as long, _ ' ink red
  inkG   as long, _ ' ink green
  inkB   as long, _ ' ink blue
  paperR as long, _ ' paper red
  paperG as long, _ ' paper green
  paperB as long, _ ' paper blue
  x      as long, _ ' x co-ord
  y      as long, _ ' y co-ord
  w      as long, _ ' width
  h      as long, _ ' height
  max    as long, _ ' max chars
  hTB    as long    ' returns a handle to the new control

close #rmfdll

The HEX strings can be any valid HEX value
as shown in the test programme.
The ink and paper parameters can be any
value between 0 and 255.

I have also been asked if there is a list of hex numbers
and corresponding color names. Liberty BASIC only recognises
sixteen predefined colour names that can be used with the
three COLOR commands. Most browsers recognise a total of
140 predefined colour names. To help use these 140 colour
names from within Liberty BASIC, I have developed a small
LB utility that will display all thes colours. Any colours
that are required in an LB programme can then be defined
within that programme and used in the same way as RED,
GREEN and BLUE numerical values are already be used.

The files that I have included are:
	rmfDLLv02.dll		- DLL
	rmfDLLv02.c		- DLL source code
	aboutrmfDLLv02.txt	- Explanation file
	testDLLv02.bas		- Tests the DLL
	colours.bas		- Utility to show all 140 colour
				- names and their HEX and R/G/B values
	colour_names_demo.bas	- Shows how to use the colour names
	colour_data.txt		- Any colour name and its R/G/B value
				- can easily be copied from here to
				- an LB programme.

These files can be copied and modified at will.
