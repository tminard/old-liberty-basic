Hey, Jimmy!
	Here are some updates for MOH!
To use, unzip 'install.zip' to your desktop. Then run 
'Mohaa mods.exe' or whatever. Right now, i would install everthing in
the 'addons' button. To install those, just double click one item
in the 'availible list', then click the 'install' button.
For allies weapons (axis are not yet availible!), hit the 'allies'
button in the main window. Then choose your weapon for each group!
After you have chosen some, click 'update'. To install some 
Japan stuff, (Levels, people, etc) click 'install mod' button
on the main window. To run the Heck in the Pacific game, click
'default game',  then select 'Heck in the Pacific' or 'HTP' or 
something. You can only change the default game AFTER you
installed the 'install mod' button!. You may need to restart 
the program after you click 'install mod' for the 'default game'
button to be avialable. I will fix this soon!
I will need this CD back.

Update #1
    -Hey Jimmy! after you install my program, move the 'mohaa mods.tkn'
file from the CD to the folder that the old 'mohaa mods.tkn' file
is in. Overwrite that file with this one!
